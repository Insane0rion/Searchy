# Searchy!


<b>Searchy!</b> is a CLI search engine.</br>
At the moment it supports <b>3</b> websites: </br></br>
 <b>Wikipedia.org</br>
 DuckDuckgo.com</br>
 Youtube.com</b>    (videos only at the moment)</br>(You need to add your API-KEY generated by Google to youre settings.ini file to use this engine if you don't know how to get one read [this](https://rapidapi.com/blog/how-to-get-youtube-api-key/)!)
 
 
 <div>
 First starting it will create a settings.ini file in the directory where the script is stored.
 In the settings.ini file you can specify the standard amount and engine and set your Youtube-API key!
 
 To use the engine simply enter your query lauching the script, please consider that it's necessary to replace whitespaces with '_' i.e.:
 </div>
  <code>"python main.py reverse_list_python" # Will print the results of duckduckgo</code></div></br></br>
  
 If you want to look with another engine simply add the flag -e or --engine:
  
  <code>"python main.py -e wiki golden_sun" # Will print the results of wiki </code></br>
 or</br>
  <code>"python main.py --engine yt asdf_movie" # Will print the video results of yt</code></br>
  
 and to have an overview which engines are availible simply enter:</br>
  
  <code>"python main.py --show-engines" | </code></br>
  
 To change the amount of results beeing displayed:</br>
  
   <code>"python main.py -N 5 T-Rex" # Will only show 5 results </code></br>
  or</br>
   <code>"python main.py -e wiki --amt 5 Sex_Pistols" # Will only show the first 5 results from wikipedia</code></br></br>
   
 For a better user experience I recommend you creating a simpel bash script to run the script and place it in your /usr/local/bin/ directory so you can launch
 Searchy! from anywhere!
